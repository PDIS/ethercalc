Linksholder is a document and bookmark collecting app, forked from Hackfoldr 2.0 (http://beta.hackfoldr.org/).
You can organize links with folders or labels, and open them in a new tab with one click.

This app is currently only available in Traditional Chinese, but of course you can use it in any environment.
